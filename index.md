# About

Scientists working in a multitude of disciplines rely heavily on 
computing technologies for their research. Numerical simulations
run on supercomputers are used in the study of climate, weather,
atmospheric chemistry, wildfires, space weather, and more. Similarly, 
a tremendous volume of digital data produced by numerical simulations,
or observations made with instruments, are analyzed with the help
of powerful computers and software. Thus, todayâ€™s scientists require
not only expertise in their scientific discipline, but also require
high-level technical skills to effectively analyze, manipulate, and
make sense of potentially vast volumes of data. Computing environments
change rapidly, and two technologies that have emerged and are being
adopted by scientific communities relatively recently are Cloud
Computing platforms and a software ecosystem of scientific tools
built around the open source programming language called Python.
Project Pythia will provide a public, web-accessible training
resource that will help educate current, and aspiring, earth
scientists to more effectively use both the Scientific Python
Ecosystem and Cloud Computing to make sense of huge volumes of
numerical scientific data.

Project Pythia is a community effort led by NCAR and the University
of Albany, and funded by NSF EarthCube award #2026899
