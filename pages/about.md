## About

Pythia is a community educational resource for helping students, scientists,
and educators learn how to analyze and visualize geosciences data using
the Scientifc Python Ecosystem.

### Project Pythia Goals

1. *The Pythia Portal:* Provide a searchable online portal that
provides scientists at any point in their career with educational
content and real-world examples needed to learn how to navigate and
integrate the myriad packages within the Python ecosystem for the
geosciences.

2. *Cloud-Deployable Pythia Platforms:* Provides a light-weight,
Binder-based platform that will make it possible to launch portal
content in customizable executable environments in the Cloud with
a “single click.”
